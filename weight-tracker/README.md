# Weight Tracker App

A simple React app to track daily weight with a calendar-style UI and weekly averages.  
(Additional feature planned: daily + next-day weather info.)

## ðŸ“… Development Log

### Day 1 (Setup & GitHub)
- âœ… Created new React project using Vite
- âœ… Installed dependencies and confirmed local server is running
- âœ… Initialized Git repository
- âœ… Added `.gitignore` to keep repo clean
- âœ… Created `.vscode/settings.json` for formatting & linting
- âœ… Wrote first commit and pushed project to GitHub

**Notes / Learnings:**
- Learned how `.gitignore` prevents unwanted files like `node_modules` from going to GitHub  
- Got familiar with basic Git commands: `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`  
- Understood that keeping documentation day by day helps in tracking progress and building good habits

### Upcoming (Day 2 Plan)
- Setup project folder structure  
- Add a calendar layout UI (for the current month)  
- Add input boxes under each date (to enter weight, not yet saving)
